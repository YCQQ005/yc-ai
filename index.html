        <p>This site presents the cognitive architecture and training methodology behind GPT-DD — a personality-aware, post-trained LLM assistant developed through a method called quasi Test-Time Training (quasi-TTT). The approach focuses not just on output performance, but on aligning AI reasoning with human rhythm, context, and values.</p>

        <p>These materials were prepared as part of an application to <strong>Social Systems Intelligence (SSI)</strong> — a forward-looking initiative exploring how AI systems can co-adapt and co-reason with human social systems.</p>

        <p>Here you’ll find project documentation, selected Q&A responses, and conceptual tools such as IQA, 3AA, and TD/TW frameworks — all part of a long-term mission to build reflective, trustworthy AI that grows alongside us.</p>

        <p>My goal isn’t just to use AI more efficiently, but to shape how it understands and collaborates — toward a future where intelligence is not only powerful, but also wise.</p>
